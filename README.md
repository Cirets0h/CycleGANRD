# CycleGANRD

Base of CycleGan is from https://github.com/aitorzip/PyTorch-CycleGAN with small changes.

Base of the reading discriminator is from https://github.com/georgeretsi/HTR-ctc and heavily changed. It was primarly used for the data loader and to have a functioning base to build on top of that. The model CRNN is adopted without changes from https://github.com/olivernina/nephi
